                        <p>A big part of having an ‘exit strategy’ is knowing the value of your business and if that value is increasing to meet your personal financial goals.  This calculator uses one of the most popular methods of analyzing your business value based on the cash flow you are generating.  It’s only one of many approaches, and you can use it to ‘check-in’ on yourself about the value of your business.</p>

                        <a href="/tools-resources/cash-flow-calculator/">Cash Flow Calculator</a>
                        <p>The concept of ‘cash flow’ is often poorly explained and more often used too little, particularly by founding entrepreneurs who are pretty sure they never started their business to become accountants! AND...having a firm grip on your cash flow is really important! (If you don’t believe us, just ask your Banker.)  Use this calculator to better understand the ‘ins-and-outs’ of cash flow.</p>

                        <p>Get your facts together before you even start talking to your Banker about a commercial loan.  This calculator will quickly help you figure out the debt service requirements (that’s the principle and interest payments combined that have to be paid out of cash flow) of a new loan.  It also calculated your debt service coverage ratio. Being armed with this information as you start talking about borrowing money sets you apart from the crowd and demonstrates you have a great handle on your finances...and you do!</p>

It will show you how your debt service coverage ratios (a very important set of ratios for your Banker) are impacted by changing income and capex assumptions.</p>

                        <p>Growth eats cash! Growing too fast can...and will… grow you right out of business if you don’t understand the working capital required to fuel the growth.  Working Capital is another of those misunderstood, under appreciated areas of balance sheet analysis that is where way too many entrepreneurs get in trouble.  Our work with entrepreneurs and CEO’s over nearly 20 years has validated too often that failing to manage the balance sheet is where the biggest financial troubles crop up.  Use this calculator to get a firm handle on the cash requirements of growth...or how much cash you can free up with more effective working capital management.</p>
